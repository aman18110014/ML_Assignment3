Time compexity during training a logistic regression model

    If w is a vector of size d. The operation yi*w^t*xi takes O(d) time.
    Looping it on n data points and to find the max sum:  n steps
    Therefore, time compexity = n(O(d)) = O(nd)


Time compexity during testing a logistic regression model

    For any new data point, only operation to perform w^t * xi.
    Since w is a vector of size d, the operation w^t*xi takes O(d) steps
    Therefore, time compexity = O(d)


Space compexity during training a logistic regression model

    storing in memory: x, y, w and b. 
    b is a constant, storing takes O(1) operation. 
    x and y are matrices of order (n x d) and (n x 1) respectively. 
    Storing x and y takes O(nd + n) steps. 
    w is a vector of size d. Storing it takes O(d) steps.
    Therefore, space compexity = O(nd + n +d).


Space compexity during testing a logistic regression model

    To classify the data points we only perform w^t*x1.
    Therefore, space compexity = O(d)
